Lab 12 Building Your Voice Agent - Conversational AI in Action


1)	Branch Design Challenge:
a)	The most challenging part of designing the branches was figuring out how it all worked. I ended up playing around a bit at first and then began with a template. From there I added the subagents and end call conditions. After an hour or so it became easy to work with and design.
b)	I was amazed, again, by how this technology works. Incredible in what it can do, how it can simplify questions, information gathering, and be very educational. The ability to answer the questions with completeness and accuracy along with being able to be interrupted and easily move to another topic within the agent.

2)	Knowledge Base Impact:
a)	The agent’s response from the knowledge base was amazing. I made several different calls and then the responses to the questions were faster. I am assuming because it was learning about the question(s) and becoming more familiar with the knowledge base.
b)	Overall, it seemed the knowledge base content, whether a URL or pdf, the interaction with the agent was at the same speed, a bit less latency with repetitiveness of the same question.

3)	Real-World Application:
a)	This could be a great trivia source for movies. Creating a potential website that contained 1,000’s of movies (AI could help tremendously in designing and obtaining content) and their respective trivia and other relative information. For example, duplicate the agent for “A Clockwork Orange” or “Full Metal Jacket”, for Stanley Kubrick. Also doing the same for other producers, directors, actors or soundtracks. 
b)	Trivia websites or maybe even making a Q&A website that could be interactive in various media forms. MCP would be of exceptional value in designing all of this.

In closing, through the course many of the labs were intimidating in the beginning, and even frustrating, but at the end of each they were exceptionally educational and even fun. For some, as in this one, I tried to think outside the box and even tried to implement some humor with this one (English female voice to be HAL 9000 – even a bit sexy). Thank you for all we’ve learned this semester.
